The grounds that appear in the TesseLace index are the result of research by [Veronika Irvine](https://tesselace.com/about) and were generated using the [TesseLace algorithm](https://tesselace.com/research/bridges2012/).  Some of these grounds are familiar, traditional grounds.  Others have not been found in known catalogues and are likely new.

In the following tables, 
* click on the **image** to see thread and pair diagrams in [GroundForge],
* click on **txt** to download a template file for use with the bobbin lace [plugins for Inkscape](https://tesselace.com/tools/inkscape-extension/),
* click on **svg** to move intersection positions around.  

Families of patterns are variations of the same pattern with [modified pin positions](/GroundForge/help/Reshape-Patterns).
Note: Currently, GroundForge does not support pin positions therefore the thread diagrams for all members of a family look the same.
